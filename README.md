# KML Data Extractor

## Overview
This script extracts data from a KML file and determines which region each set of coordinates belongs to. It supports spatial analysis using the `rgeo` gem to check if points fall within predefined regional boundaries.

## Features
- Parses KML files and extracts relevant data fields.
- Uses geospatial calculations to determine if coordinates belong to:
  - **Parlimen Cheras**
  - **Bandar Tun Razak**
  - **Parlimen Seputeh** (default if outside both regions)
- Outputs results into a structured CSV file for further analysis.

## Usage
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   gem install ruby_kml nokogiri rgeo awesome_print csv
   ```
2. **Run the script:**
   ```sh
   ruby script.rb
   ```
3. **Output:** The extracted data is saved as `placemarks_data.csv`.

## Important Note
ðŸš¨ **DO NOT COMMIT KML FILES TO THIS REPOSITORY** ðŸš¨

The KML files contain **confidential data** and should never be included in version control. Ensure they are securely stored and accessed only by authorized users.
